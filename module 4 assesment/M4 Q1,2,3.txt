1. Explain the connection procedure followed in client server communication

First inorder to perform communication between a client and a server a socket has to be created between both client and server. Next on the server side we must bind the socket and then the server will listen for client. 
The client will send a request to establish connection with server, once the request reached server, the connection between client and server will be established.
Once the connection is established, the client can request a data from the server and server can respond with the desired data.

2. What is the use of bind() function in socket programming  ? 

This function is used to associate a socket with a soecific ip addess and the port number.

3. What is Datagram Socket ? 

These are the type of socket that allows processes to use UDP to communicate. A datagram socket supports bidirectional flow of messages. A process on a datagram socket may receive messages in a different order from the sending sequence and may receive duplicate messages. Record boundaries in the data are preserved. The socket is SOCK_DGRAM.
